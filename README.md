# ColorSwitch
Its a very addictive game developed on UNITY. The main objects are a ball and different shapes. These shapes consist of three or four colors. You may think this looks nice but this may change when you need escort a colored ball throughout these shapes. This ball can only touch areas that have the same color. So a pink ball is not allowed to touch a purple or yellow area. Keep bouncing, find a way throughout the shapes and donâ€™t give up.

# Running the Project
